Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.
Here is an extra line.
Another line. I need to write something creative or meaningful.
The Buffalo Bills just lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round. AGAIN. In a tragic, heart-wrenching fashion. This time it wasn't Mahomes and 13 Seconds remaining. This time it was the kicker again. It was literally wide right. AGAIN. It's ok for the Strouds to loose to Baltimore. Their defense was just a monster and Lamar was doing Lamar things. The Packers eff'd it up like Buffalo but they're young and they will prosper in the future. But the Bills? It feels like their time is up. How many chances do you need? Josh Allen can do whatever he wants, either Mahomes or his own kicker is gonna cost him the season.
